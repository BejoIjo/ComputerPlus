**Current Features**
- Ability to search for persons and vehicles without keys conflicting with other mods.
- Uses the LSPDFR API to get ped and vehicle information. Also includes info left out of the regular LSPDFR police computer, like times stopped and number of citations.
- Uses the Traffic Policer API (if it is installed) to also show a vehicle's insurance information.
- Search fields are automatically filled out with the subject's information during a traffic stop, so all you have to do is press a button!
- Dynamic backgrounds! Depending on which police vehicle you're in, you'll get a specialized department background. Comes with RDE support.
- Looks practically identical to the LCPDFR computer (in terms of the layout).
- Active Calls screen, which shows all callouts sent by Dispatch, even the ones that AI units respond to! (Must have participating callout plugins installed for this to work)
- Computer+ now has its own API, for callout developers to use!!
- [NEW] Computer+ can now integrate UI interfaces from third party apps through API. Check the ExampleExternalUI sample under API Examples
- [NEW] Computer+ can now hide the background and unpause the game while the computer is active
- [NEW] Completely overhauled UI for Ped and Vehicle searches
- [NEW] Computer+ integrates with ALPR+ and can show ALPR alerts in the vehicle details view
- [NEW] Computer+ will now contain a list of recent searches either populated manually or via automatic searching
- [NEW] Computer+ will automatically add ALPR hit vehicles to the recent vehicle search list
- [NEW] Computer+ will automatically add Peds who have been stopped by the player to the collected ids ped search list

**Troubleshooting**

- If your mouse does not appear in Computer+, then make sure the display resolution in game matches your windows display resolution. If the resolutions do not match, you will not see a mouse cursor
- If you play in windows or windows borderless mode, make sure to keep your mouse inside of the game window until the game fully loads

**Planned Improvements**
- Integration with Albo1125's British Policing Script.
- Combining Computer+ and fiskey111's LSPDFR PolicingMDT into one mod.
