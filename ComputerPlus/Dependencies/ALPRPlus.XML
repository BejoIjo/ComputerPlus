            Sets the ALPR flag/result for a specific vehicle. This will go in the Subtitle field of the notification, so make sure the string is not too long.
            You are able to use RPH color codes, such as ~b~ and ~r~.
            NOTE: This function will NOT set corresponding Persona or Vehicle details to match the flag you set; that part is YOUR responsibility!!

            Gets the (pre-defined or custom) ALPR flag for a specific vehicle. Pre-defined EAlertType flags will be returned as their string representation.

            <param name="veh">The Vehicle to get the flag for.</param>

            <summary>
            Gets a list of all ALPR scan results, as well as API-defined results.
            </summary>
            <returns>A Generic List of ALPRScanResult objects. ALPRScanResult contains the Vehicle, and the result, represented as a string. 
            The data is sorted by the time the alert was last displayed (newest first).
            The list will be empty if no results are found. Errors will be logged.</returns>

        <member name="E:Stealth.Plugins.ALPRPlus.API.Functions.ALPRFlagGenerated">
            <summary>
            Raised when ALPR+ creates/generates a flag for a vehicle. Keep in mind that there is only a certain chance (15% by default) of an alert being triggered.
            This event is only thrown once, when the alert is actually "created" for that particular vehicle.
            This event is ONLY triggered when ALPR+ generates a flag, not when one is created via the API.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="E:Stealth.Plugins.ALPRPlus.API.Functions.ALPRResultDisplayed">
            <summary>
            Raised any time ALPR+ displays an alert for a vehicle. This could be an alert generated by ALPR+, or created by another plugin via the API.
            This event can be triggered multiple times for a vehicle.
            However, once an alert is displayed for a vehicle, it is not displayed again for a certain period of time, to minimize spamming the user.
            By default, this "buffer" period is 30 seconds.
